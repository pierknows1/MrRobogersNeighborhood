inputted. 
* If a number in the array contains a 1, the number is replaced with the phrase Beep!
* If a number in the array contains a 2, the number is replaced with the phrase Boop!
* If a number in the array contains a 3, the number is replaced with the phrase Won't you be my neighbor?, along with the inputted 'name'.
